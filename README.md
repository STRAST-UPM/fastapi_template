# Template Python Project 

Template for a Fast API project. This template is based on the
[python_project_template](https://github.com/STRAST-UPM/python_project_template)
from STRAST research group that can be found in the same organization as this 
one. The same structure of files and folder applies, check the original for more
detailed information.

## Project Structure

This section describe the updates made to the base template to fit FastAPI
properly.

### Files and folders updates

- `code/src/classes/routers` is the package used to keep the routers that
control the different main endpoints.

## Deployment on containers

As it was told this project was though to be used with containers for easy
deployment. The base containers deployed are the project developed and a
PostgreSQL database with a web administration console accesible. The following
URL is for the [FastAPI Docs](http://localhost) and the second one for the
[Postgres admin console](http://localhost:8080). The database and administration
console have permanent storage via Docker volumes.

- Build project image
```shell
sudo docker build -t user/fastapi_template:latest .
```

- Push image to repository
```shell
sudo docker push user/fastapi_template:latest
```

- Run project just project container
```shell
sudo docker run \
  -p "8000:8000" \
  --name fastapi_template \
  -d user/fastapi_template:latest
```

- Start deployment
```shell
sudo docker compose up -d
```
